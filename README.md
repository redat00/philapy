# Philapy

Philapy is just a small bot used to scrap Philarmonie's website and send alerts messages to Telegram. It uses Redis for storing concert he has already found in order to prevent it from resending alert with already sent content.

## To do

There is still some stuff to do to make this bot more robust. Here's a short like of those things.

- Writing unit test for all the differents classes and functions
- Adding CI/CD to the project
